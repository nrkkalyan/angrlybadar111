1:- What is the Design architectural choices made during the development ?

4 layer architecture. 
		i) Presentation Layer
	   ii) Business Logic Layer
	  iii) Persistence Layer
	   iV) Database Layer.
	   

Transaction Script: 
		Where Transaction Script is a method that handles requests from Presentation Layer 
		organizes the domain logic and accessing the database through DAO. 
		Since transaction script pattern access the request from the Presentation Layer so the code may get larger
		and thus making harder to maintain.
		Thus use this pattern only when the domain logic is simple.  
It could be a good choice.

Model-Delegate: Suitable for Swing based application.
		
Domain Driven Design: Not used as it could be overkill.


Dependency Injection: Not suitable for our situation as its complex for our implementation.
