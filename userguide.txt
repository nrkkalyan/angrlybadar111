-------- 1. Overview --------

The application helps the UrlyBird customer service representatives(CSRs) to book hotel rooms for their customers. 
CSRs can able to view the availability of rooms, name of the hotel, location and other information. 
One can even search rooms by hotel name, location or a combination of both. 

Note: The search is case sensitive 



-------- 2. How to run the application --------

The application could be started in 2 modes from the command line.
	Run the command:
	java -jar runme.jar [optional <application_mode>]
	If <application_mode> must be given, then it could be one of the following values "alone" or "server"
		alone = Starts the application client in stand alone mode
		server = Starts the application as server.
		no args = Starts the application client in a network mode. Must be used in combination with the "server" mode.  



-------- 3. Application Configuration --------
The configuration information with respect to the application is persisted in suncertify.properties file.
Any prior values in the file will be used in the application accordingly.
Note: The configuration values is persisted and overwritten between the runs of the application.
		
		
		
-------- 4. Starting the application in non-network mode --------
In order to start the application in stand alone mode one must run the following command in a command line
	java -jar runme.jar alone
	
	This will open a dialog box with default value of "db-1x1.db" in the database file input box. 
	If one wants to select a different file other than provided by default then they can do that with the help of browse button.
	
	Once the database path is provided the user must press OK which will save the database file path in the suncertify.properties file.
	Any failure to parse the database file(i.e invalid magic code ,wrong file etc) will exit the application.
	Otherwise the application will start by displaying a list of available rooms.
	Please see section 7 (UrlyBird Gui) below for further information about GUI functionalities.
	
	Note: In this mode both the gui and the database will run in the same VM.
	 


-------- 5. Starting the application as server --------
In order to start the application as server one must run the following command in the command line.
	java -jar runme.jar server
	
	This will open a dialog box and will  



!Important: to work with the client application u need a running instance of the server application (s. 3.)!

There are two ways to start the client application: 

1. Through the command line:
	- open a command line
	- go with the command line to the directory of the runme.jar file.
	- type: java -jar runme.jar
2. By double clicking:
	- go in your explorer to the directory of the runme.jar file
	- double click on it.

Either way starts a dialog in which u could establish a connection to the server.
To connect to the server fill the host field with the server address (for example "localhost")
and the port field with the port number to connect to (for example "1099").
The port text field only accepts digits.	

If you filled both fields you can connect to the server by clicking the "connect" button.
The client connects now to the server and shows you the UrlyBirdView (s. 5.).
If the client can not establish a connection an error window is shown with a description of the problem.



-------- 4. Starting the server application --------

!Important the server application starts only a server, to retrieve or modify any data you need a connected instance of the client application (s. 2.)!

You could start the server application through the command line:
	- open a command line
	- go with the command line to the directory of the runme.jar file.
	- type: java -jar runme.jar server

A dialog starts in which u can configure the path of the database the server should use and the address under which the server should be started.
	- To specify the database click on the button "Select" and choose a file with the now opened file chooser.
	- To specify the address fill the field "Host" and "Port" (the port field only accepts digits).

At the head of the dialog is a label that provides you with status information about the server.
If you have filled all fields you could start the server with the button "Start Server".

If the server is running it could be shut down by clicking the Button "Stop Server".




-------- 5. The UrlyBirdView --------

The UrlyBirdView is the main gui of the UrlyBird application.
In the center of the view is the table that displays the rooms that are stored in the database (by clicking on the button "all").

The table is sortable and you could change the sequence of the columns by drag and drop.
The following columns are displayed for every room:
	 - "ID": an unique identifier for the room.
	 - "Hotel Name": the name of the hotel that offers the room.
	 - "Location": the name of the city where the hotel is located at.
	 - "Room Size": the size of the room in persons.
	 - "Smoking": if smoking is allowed ("Y") or disallowed ("N") in this room.
	 - "Price": the price of the room in US Dollar $.
	 - "Date": the occupancy of this room.
	 - "Customer ID": the id of the customer that has booked the room.

The following buttons are available:
	 - "All": searches for all stored rooms in the database and displays them in the table.
	 - "Find": Opens a find dialog in which u could execute a search for room which city and/or location name begins with a specified string. 
	  			You could also select the checkbox "any" to search for any city and/or location name.

	 - "Book": Opens a dialog in which a could insert the customer id (only 8 digits are allowed) of the customer that wants to book the room.
